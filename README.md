## Java OOPS
This repository contains projects and assignments from a Java learning course focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Through this course, I gained a solid understanding of OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. The topics covered include class and object creation, constructors, method overloading and overriding, interfaces, and abstract classes. Additionally, the repository includes hands-on exercises and projects that demonstrate the application of these concepts in real-world scenarios.
